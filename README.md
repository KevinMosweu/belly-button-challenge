## Description

The aim of this challenge is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the following dataset: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

The data showcases a catalogue of microbe species(reffered to as OTUs) present in the navel of a group of people. 

There are 3 deliverables in the exercise.

## Part 1

A horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in the selected test subject. The hover text displays the name of the bacteria and the size of the sample collected. This appears as follows:

## Part 2

A bubble chart displaying each sample found in the selected test subject. The size of the bubbles correspond to the size of the sample. The hover text displays the name of the bacteria and the sample size. This appears as follows:
